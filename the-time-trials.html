        <p>
          Within just 3 days, the human thinks it's high noon when it's the dead of night.  I'd understand that from the little Synechococcus, but it's actually doing a better job than the human!
        </p>
        <p>
          I mean... don't they both have <b>Circadian Rhythms</b> that pretty accurately measure 24 hours?  I thought this would be a home run for them...
        </p>
        <p>
          I guess when they don't have something to sync up their rythms they're not very accurate...

            Well... I mean, it's all just sort of related to memory, how long events <b>feel</b>.  It's called <b>time dilation</b>.
            You know, my memories don't all take up the same amount of space, and they're not stored sequentially like a film camera, they're just kind of all over the place.

            Well when it moves too fast then it kind of freaks me out, and my adrenaline rushes, and I pay a ton of attention to it.  So it seems like it must've happened for a long time.

          Oh, okay, well that kind of makes sense.  When you're in a dangerous situation, you're able to perceive faster and perceive more.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's sort of like if your mind normally recorded at 60 frames per second, but when you're in danger, it speeds up to 140 frames per second.  Then, when you play it back, it's like in slow-mo, and so it seems longer.  That's pretty cool Brainy!

            Well... haha um... actually I don't think it's like that.  When I'm in danger I don't actually perceive any faster or better.  I perceive like regular.  I'm just paying more attention to a bunch of things, so it feels like it's longer.  But it's not like I get slow-mo vision.

            Yeah, I mean, it's pretty all over the place.  Like, I said boring things seem like they take forever, right?  But also, when I think about other boring things, like my commute to work, over time they start to feel like they don't take any time at all!
          </p>
          <p>
            It seems like any change in all the different parts of me and how I'm feeling can affect my sense of time in a whole bunch of ways.  And if there's anything I don't understand, it's my feelings.  Therapy helps though!

            But, look on the bright side!  This is actually pretty cool and useful!  I mean, think about it: I'm not fixed to a rhythm, <b>time changes with how I'm feeling!</b>  I learn more from dangerous moments. I can spend less energy focusing on the accuracy of time and instead spend it focusing on other things. And painfully boring days don't take up as much of my memory as exciting moments, like seeing a movie with friends!  Isn't that so cool?

          Well, Human, I could only find one more challenge that's any easier for you to try.
        </p>
        <p>
          All you have to do is <b>say which order these two things happened in
          </b>.  Got it?  You don't even have to challenge anyone.  You just have to be able to do it.
        </p>
        <p>
          We're going to hit this drum.  And you tell me in which order you <b>SAW</b> the drum get hit and <b>HEARD</b> the drum get hit.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'll even give you a hint, the speed of light is 299,792,458 meters per second. The speed of sound is only 343 meters per second. You know how you see thunder much sooner than you hear it?
        </p>
        <p>
          I'll stand all the way back here, so the drum's about 12 feet away from you.  And just to make sure you get this right I'll just say it: you should heard the sound roughly <b>10 milliseconds</b> after the light.  I've done the research, even you can perceive that difference in time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ready?  Let's hit the drum a few times.

            So the top line on the surface is my objective <b>sensation</b>.  That's the information that actually hits my eyes and ears.  And the light hits my eyes first, because, like you said, it's much faster than sound.

            Well, my subjective <b>perception</b> is what I actually <b>feel</b>.  Not what hits my eyes and ears, but what happens when those sense organs and I (the <b>brain</b>) finish processing it.  That's the big purple nebulous area.

            Okay, so, think about it.  When you hit the drum, it <b>causes</b> both the light and the sound.  So at the origin, the space where you make contact, they happen <b>at the same time</b>.  But, by the time they reach my senses, there's a delay, because they travel at different speeds.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p>
          Right.  That's how space and time works, information takes time to travel.  It's why the stars we see in the sky lightyears away may be completely different than what we see.  And on a smaller scale it's why if I throw you a banana, the banana that I throw is slightly more green than the one you end up catching.  The same with light and sound.  I think we're on the same page for once.  Though I think I may also just be getting hungry.

        <div class="rText">
          <p>
            Well here's the cool part.  Each time you hit the drum, the delay between the sight and sound is really short, and roughly the same each time.  So if you keep on doing it, I get to thinking...
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="rText">
          <p>
            If the delay is always the same amount, then that probably means something <b>caused</b> them both.  And each time it happens I get more and more sure about my hunch, like, statistically!  And so, if I'm pretty sure they were caused by the same thing, well, why don't I just try to imagine they happened at the same time?

            I just start to squish them closer together, so they eventually happen at the same time in my mind, because I'm pretty darn sure they originally happened at the same time to begin with.  And then it becomes one, single, easy to digest concept.  It's called <b>Lag Adaptation!</b>

          Even though to really prove objectively that the drum hit caused the light and sound, you'd have to be both where you are and at the drum at the same time?  You're pretending you can be in more than one place at the same time?

They're so complicated anyway, <i>this way of thinking about the world is so much easier</i>  To be honest, I don't even really have to think about it, it just happens!

            Oops, sorry, sorry! I was still used to the old delay!  This new one is much faster... I mean, look, I did end up getting there! I just needed to take a few tries to re-adjust to the new, shorter delay!

          Brainy... did you just honestly... 'Perceive'... that the light somehow turned on <b>before</b> you flipped the switch?

        <p>  I thought this worked like time dilation, where you just change the size of time!  What happened to <b>squishing</b>, smushing, whatever!!  Squishing never <b>reversed the order of things!!!</b>  That was the <i>whole point of this challenge</i>!  This is the 'Fill in Your Name Here' of challenges!  You literally just sensed two things happen in order, and then decided to flip them around!  I mean, do you think the light somehow knew you were going to press it?  Or that you pressed the button and then the light travelled back in time??

            Yeah... I guess squishing isn't really the right way to think about it, hm...  I guess it's more like... moving?  Editing?

            But I mean... remember that time I was able to use the sun to know what time it was?  Pretty cool right?  Now how do you think I did then at the whole time trials thing?

          Well at least I got a medal.  Cici said they actually don't usually make a last place medal.  But she was really insistant on it.

          But you know what?  Who really cares about these elaborate challenges?  I mean, I get it, I'm not good at keeping track of time, but I've invented things to help me with that!  I might not be good at remembering how long things took, but that's because I'm busy focusing on what things <i>mean</i>.  And sure, sometimes you can trick my time perception, but that's just the kryptonite to my statistics super power!
        </p>
        <p>
          My time might not be objectively correct, but it's subjectively <i>awesome</i>.  I get to time lapse boring moments and slow down important ones with time dilation.  And with lag adaptation I get to break space-time and live in a simpler version of the world that makes more sense.

          And as for keeping track of time, that's what the alarm on my phone is for.  I'd like to see that bacteria wake up before sunrise to make their flight, hahaha.

        Thanks everyone for checking this out!  It was made in about a week for the <a style="color:#adadad"href="https://explorabl.es/">explorables jam</a>!  Go check them out!
      </p>
      <p class="tempP">
        And if you liked this, check out my other <a style="color:#adadad"href="https://www.tomlum.com/doodle-brains">doodle brains</a> like <a style="color:#adadad"href="https://www.tomlum.com/doodle-brains/1-monkey">1 Monkey</a>!
      </p>
      <p class="tempP">
        If you're the paper reading type, definitely check out the papers mentioned, they're all really clever, especially <a style="color:#adadad"href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0001295">the one</a> where they show that you don't perceive better when you're in a frightening situation.  It's a really clever procedure!  And also the <a style="color:#adadad"href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627306006271">temporal order reversal paper</a>, their theories about the implications of temporal order reversals are really interesting, and we still don't fully know!
      </p>
      <p class="tempP">
        And if you <b>really</b> like to read papers, check out the <a style="color:#adadad"href="https://www.tomlum.com/thesis"> thesis </a> I wrote that inspired this lil page!  It's about time perception and poses the question: if you can do a temporal order reversal between an action and a perception, could you manage to trick yourself into reversing the order of two actions you chose to make?  The answer?  Maybe!  And the implications about time and our consciousness perception are wild!  Science! Whoo!
